# Hypothesis test, paired t

A two-sample t test answers these questions:

1. Is the average of a sample from process 1 different from the average of a sample from process 2?
2. Is the average of a sample from process 1 greater than the average of a sample from process 2?
3. Is the average of a sample from process 1 less than the average of a sample from process 2?
4. Is the average of a sample from process 1 different from the average of a sample from process 2 by a predetermined amount?
